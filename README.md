Finish 3co
========
App developed on HackaRB [http://www.hackarb.com/](http://www.hackarb.com/). Provides a simple but intuitive way of understanding the purpose of a dish washer and how much water it can save on the long run. Also provides a sample on how a loyalty program could be implemented, using MTO's as a gateway for a higher throughput of Finish® sales.

Built in less than 4 hours, still a proof of concept. Runs on every iOS release since 7.1.
